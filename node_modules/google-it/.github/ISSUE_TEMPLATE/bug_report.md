**Version of google-it**
If you have it installed globally, please run `npm list google-it -g` in your command prompt of choice, and that should result in an output that looks like this:
```
/Users/patneedham/.nvm/versions/node/v11.4.0/lib
└── google-it@1.2.0 
``` 
If you don't have it installed globally, simply remove the `-g` flag from that command.

**Versions of npm and node**
Please run `npm --version` and `node --version` and paste in the results.

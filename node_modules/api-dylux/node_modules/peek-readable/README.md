# peek-readable

A promise based asynchronous stream reader, which makes reading from a stream easy.

Allows to read and peek from a [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams)

This module is used by [strtok3](https://github.com/Borewit/strtok3)

The `peek-readable` contains one class: `StreamReader`, which reads from a [stream.Readable](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable).

- Class `StreamReader` is used to read from Node.js [stream.Readable](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable).
- Class `WebStreamReader` is used to read from [ReadableStream<Uint8Array>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream)

## Compatibility

Module: version 5 migrated from [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) to [pure ECMAScript Module (ESM)](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
JavaScript is compliant with [ECMAScript 2019 (ES10)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#10th_Edition_%E2%80%93_ECMAScript_2019).
Requires Node.js â‰¥ 14.16 engine.

## Usage

### Installation

```shell script
npm install --save peek-readable
```

## API Documentation

Both `StreamReader` and `WebStreamReader` implement the [IStreamReader interface](#istreamreader-interface).

### `IStreamReader` Interface

The `IStreamReader` interface defines the contract for a stream reader,
which provides methods to read and peek data from a stream into a `Uint8Array` buffer.
The methods are asynchronous and return a promise that resolves with the number of bytes read.

#### Methods

##### `peek` function
This method allows you to inspect data from the stream without advancing the read pointer.
It reads data into the provided Uint8Array at a specified offset but does not modify the stream's internal position, 
allowing you to look ahead in the stream.

```ts  
peek(uint8Array: Uint8Array, offset: number, length: number): Promise<number>
```

Parameters:
- `uint8Array`: `Uint8Array`: The buffer into which the data will be peeked.
  This is where the peeked data will be stored.
- `offset`: `number`: The offset in the Uint8Array where the peeked data should start being written.
- `length`: `number`: The number of bytes to peek from the stream.

Returns `Promise<number>`: 
A promise that resolves with the number of bytes actually peeked into the buffer. 
This number may be less than the requested length if the end of the stream is reached.

##### `read` function
```ts  
read(buffer: Uint8Array, offset: number, length: number): Promise<number>
```

Parameters:
- `uint8Array`: `Uint8Array`: The buffer into which the data will be read.
  This is where the read data will be stored.
- `offset`: `number`: The offset in the Uint8Array where the read data should start being written.
- `length`: `number`: The number of bytes to read from the stream.

Returns `Promise<number>`:
A promise that resolves with the number of bytes actually read into the buffer.
This number may be less than the requested length if the end of the stream is reached.

##### `abort` function

Abort active asynchronous operation (`read` or `peak`) before it has completed.

```ts  
abort(): Promise<void>
```

## Examples

In the following example we read the first 16 bytes from a stream and store them in our buffer.
Source code of examples can be found [here](test/examples.ts).

```js
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { StreamReader } from 'peek-readable';

(async () => {
  const readable = fs.createReadStream('JPEG_example_JPG_RIP_001.jpg');
  const streamReader = new StreamReader(readable);
  const uint8Array = new Uint8Array(16);
  const bytesRead = await streamReader.read(uint8Array, 0, 16);;
  // buffer contains 16 bytes, if the end-of-stream has not been reached
})();
```

End-of-stream detection:
```js
(async () => {

  const fileReadStream = fs.createReadStream('JPEG_example_JPG_RIP_001.jpg');
  const streamReader = new StreamReader(fileReadStream);
  const buffer = Buffer.alloc(16); // or use: new Uint8Array(16);

  try {
    await streamReader.read(buffer, 0, 16);
    // buffer contains 16 bytes, if the end-of-stream has not been reached
  } catch(error) {
    if (error instanceof EndOfStreamError) {
      console.log('End-of-stream reached');
    }
  }
})();
```

With `peek` you can read ahead:
```js
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { StreamReader } from 'peek-readable';

const fileReadStream = fs.createReadStream('JPEG_example_JPG_RIP_001.jpg');
const streamReader = new StreamReader(fileReadStream);
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(20);

(async () => {
  let bytesRead = await streamReader.peek(buffer, 0, 3);
  if (bytesRead === 3 && buffer[0] === 0xFF && buffer[1] === 0xD8 && buffer[2] === 0xFF) {
    console.log('This is a JPEG file');
  } else {
    throw Error('Expected a JPEG file');
  }

  bytesRead = await streamReader.read(buffer, 0, 20); // Read JPEG header
  if (bytesRead === 20) {
    console.log('Got the JPEG header');
  } else {
    throw Error('Failed to read JPEG header');
  }
})();
```

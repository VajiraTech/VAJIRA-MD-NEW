g-i-s
=====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jimkang/g-i-s.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jimkang/g-i-s)

Another Google Image Search Node module. The nature of these things is that they eventually break as GIS changes, but this one works as of 2018-06-20.

Installation
------------

    npm install g-i-s

Usage
-----

    var gis = require('g-i-s');
    gis('cats', logResults);

    function logResults(error, results) {
      if (error) {
        console.log(error);
      }
      else {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, '  '));
      }
    }

Output:

    [
      {
        "url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mW3S0u8bj58/maxresdefault.jpg",
        "width": 1280,
        "height": 720
      },
      {
        "url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tntOCGkgt98/maxresdefault.jpg",
        "width": 1600,
        "height": 1200
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.petfinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cat-black-superstitious-fcs-cat-myths-162286659.jpg",
        "width": 632,
        "height": 353
      },
      {
        "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Large_Siamese_cat_tosses_a_mouse.jpg",
        "width": 3415,
        "height": 2268
      },
      ...
    ]

If you want to pass additional stuff to tack onto the Google image search URL, pass an object containing `searchTerm` and `queryStringAddition`. e.g.

    var opts = {
      searchTerm: 'cat',
      queryStringAddition: '&tbs=ic:trans'
    };
    gis(opts, logResults);

You can also filter out results from specfied domains:

    var opts = {
      searchTerm: 'cat',
      queryStringAddition: '&tbs=ic:trans',
      filterOutDomains: [
        'pinterest.com',
        'deviantart.com'
      ]
    };
    gis(opts, logResults);

Specifying `filterOutDomains` will both tell Google to not to include results that come from web pages on those domains and also filter image results that are hosted on those domains. (Sometimes an image is on an html page on a domain not included in your filters and has an img tag that loads from a domain that is included in your filters.)

You can pass `userAgent` in the opts to set the User-Agent header for the requests you make with this module.

Tests
-----

Run tests with `make test`.
